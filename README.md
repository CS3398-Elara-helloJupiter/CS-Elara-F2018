# CS-Elara-F2018

### Team members develop and push all artificats to their own branch of the repository. Each branch is linked to the developer by first name.


The current TAB application is split between the demo.html, script.js,style.css files.


The current TAB application can run as a dynamic web page. The page is a demo of the basic structure and flow of the final application. The current web page can navigate between different subject tasks which open up to sub tabs that contain an editable button of categories for the subjects. The window is resized according to the selection the user makes for each subject, category and subcategory. Each subcategory contains a single table that stores a list of relevant tasks, descriptions and due dates. The user is now able to run the application using the NVDA screen reader.
