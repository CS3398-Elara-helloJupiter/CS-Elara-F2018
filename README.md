Mary - was in charged of the demo.html file / Part of Script.js file located in Aaron's Branch(final updates) Mary's Branch. Mary incorporated the table using HTML and Javascript, the table allows the user to input a date, description and location of the task. In addition the JS file contains buttons that are linked to the table which allows the user to save,edit and delete the row. Such initial implementations can be found in Mary's branch. In the HTML file i pushed the implementation of the research i did about adding and removing rows on the table, such push includes the html and the js file. Mary was also in charge of making sure all files were compatable with the NVDA screen reader. When loading up the application, we want to make sure the screen reader reads everything properly, the headers had to be numbered carefully to be read by the sscreen reader. The table code in html had to have good decription in HTML. such implementations and changes can be found in Mary's Branch. The tested combination of all code is found in Aaron's branch.
