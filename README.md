  Task Access For The Blind(TAB) is an accessible task management desktop app for blind or visually impaired users. TAB was created by Samantha Hollensbe, Aaron Hunt, Louis Scinta, Jessica Cruz and Mary Gutierrez, at Texas State University and developed by Lehr Industries and CS3398 inc. TAB was designed to help blind and visually impaired users by providing an intuitive way to get and stay organized. Being visually impaired requires a person to use extensive memory to keep track of every task, every project, every deadline, every one of life’s endless to-dos, all in their head. That can be overwhelming for anybody. But for many people with a visual impairment this is often the difference between succeeding at school or work and anything else. TABS seeks to change that. 

  TAB is compatible with NVDA screen reader. When the user opens the application they are presented with a blank task card. The user can then use a key combination to add additional task cards above, below, to the left, and to the right. This process continues so that the user creates X columns and Y Rows. TAB’s simplicity allows for unsurpassed accessibility. Users can quickly navigate, dynamically add, remove, reorder, and edit task cards, and switch between task boards all from the keyboard. TAB is designed specifically for blind users to help them rapidly manage their tasks so they can get in, get out, and get on with what matters most.

Advantages – The application provides users with a smooth and easily navigable interface while delivering many robust features comparable to other leading task managers

Disadvantages – Only compatible with Windows operating system
