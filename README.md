# CS-Elara-F2018

### Team members develop and push all artificats to their own branch of the repository. Each branch is linked to the developer by first name.


The current TAB application is split between the demo.html, script.js,style.css files.


The current TAB application can run as a dynamic web page. The page is a demo of the basic structure and flow of the final application. The current web page can navigate between different subject tasks which open up to sub tabs that contain an editable button of categories for the subjects. The window is resized according to the selection the user makes for each subject, category and subcategory. Each subcategory contains a single table that stores a list of relevant tasks, descriptions and due dates. The user is now able to run the application using the NVDA screen reader.

Team Artifacts 

Mary - was in charged of the demo.html file / Part of Script.js file located in Aaron's Branch(final updates) Mary's Branch. 
Mary incorporated the table using HTML and Javascript, the table allows the user to input a date, description and location of the task. In addition the JS file contains buttons that are linked to the table which allows the user to save,edit and delete the row. Such initial implementations can be found in Mary's branch. In the HTML file i pushed the implementation of the research i did about adding and removing rows on the table, such push includes the html and the js file. 
Mary was also in charge of making sure all files were compatable with the NVDA screen reader. When loading up the application, we want to make sure the screen reader reads everything properly, the headers had to be numbered carefully to be read by the sscreen reader. The table code in html had to have good decription in HTML. such implementations and changes can be found in Mary's Branch. The tested combination of all code is found in Aaron's branch.
