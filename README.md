# CS-Elara-F2018

Team members contributed individual html files for practice, research and simple implementation design. These can be pulled, saved locally, and readily opened in any web browser.

The current TAB application is split between the index.html and style.css files.

All team members contributed to the index.html and style.css files by incorporating the best features present in indiviudal html files.

The current TAB application can run as a static web page. The page is a demo of the basic structure and flow of the final application. The current web page can navigate between different subject tasks which open up to sub tabs that contain different categories of those subjects. The window is resized according to the selection the user makes for each subject, category and subcategory. Each subcategory contains a single unique table that stores a list of relevant tasks, descriptions and due dates.
The team members jobs will be the following for the next steps
-	Mary – will implement HTML features within the code that will allow the website to run smoothly with accessibility guidelines.
-	Sam- will implement CSS features in the code and add accessibility keyboard shortcuts for easy navigation for users. 
-	Jessica – will implement the web scripting and MySQL data model of the website to allow users to save tasks. 
-	Aaron – will implement dynamic allocation features within the website.
