# CS-Elara-F2018

Team members contributed individual html files for practice, research and simple implementation design. These can be pulled, saved locally, and readily opened in any web browser.


The current TAB application is split between the html, js,css files.


The current TAB application can run as a dynamic web page. The page is a demo of the basic structure and flow of the final application. The current web page can navigate between different subject tasks which open up to sub tabs that contain an editable button of categories for the subjects. The window is resized according to the selection the user makes for each subject, category and subcategory. Each subcategory contains a single unique table that stores a list of relevant tasks, descriptions and due dates. The user is now able to run the application using the NVDA screen reader.

The team members jobs will be the following for the next steps

-	Mary – will incorporate all of the changes from each team mate and make sure the application still works correctly, by testing and change code accordingly. Mary will also be in charge of any new elements or taks needed in the html file.

-	Sam- will implement CSS and JavaScript features in the code and add accessibility keyboard shortcuts for easy navigation for users. 
-	Jessica – will implement the web scripting and MySQL data model of the website to allow users to save tasks. 
-	Aaron – will implement dynamic allocation features within the website.
