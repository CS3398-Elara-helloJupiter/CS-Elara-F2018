## TAB Application 

  
  Task Access For The Blind(TAB) is an accessible task management desktop app for blind or visually impaired users. TAB was created by Samantha Hollensbe, Aaron Hunt, Louis Scinta, Jessica Cruz and Mary Gutierrez, at Texas State University and developed by Lehr Industries and CS3398 inc. TAB was designed to help blind and visually impaired users by providing an intuitive way to get and stay organized. Being visually impaired requires a person to use extensive memory to keep track of every task, every project, every deadline, every one of life’s endless to-dos, all in their head. That can be overwhelming for anybody. But for many people with a visual impairment this is often the difference between succeeding at school or work and anything else. TABS seeks to change that. 

  TAB is compatible with NVDA screen reader. When the user opens the application they are presented with a blank task card. The user can then use a key combination to add additional task cards above, below, to the left, and to the right. This process continues so that the user creates X columns and Y Rows. TAB’s simplicity allows for unsurpassed accessibility. Users can quickly navigate, dynamically add, remove, reorder, and edit task cards, and switch between task boards all from the keyboard. TAB is designed specifically for blind users to help them rapidly manage their tasks so they can get in, get out, and get on with what matters most.

Features accomplished

Jessica: 
Jessica’s artifact is the newly implemented object  in New Category() & New Subject() functions in the script.js.
Development code located in script.js in  jessBranch and incorporated in script.js Master/demo. 
newCategory() generates a new button element in that div and creates an emepty list of subjects that are associated with that button element. newSubject() generates a new list item element in its div and creates a dynamic table that will only be associated with that subject. 
I successfully assisted in improving the dynamic elements which are present in the final script.js . Another action I planned on completing was the connection to a mySQL database and I was unable to finish that by demo time. 
Next time will be completing the database connection and the finalization of API code. 

Aaron: Implemented jQuery and JS functions with script.js.
jQuery Functionality:
Queries to automatically hide/show items in the sub-levels of selected elements based on the id’s created within the nested data structure.
Queries to delete selected elements elements and their related sub-level elements based on the id’s created within the nested data structure.

Code located in Aaron_BranchDemo and Master in file: script.js.

From Sprint 2, my improvement action was to finish the implementation of dynamically linked elements within the website. This was achieved through my commits to the script.js code and through the jQuery functionality I described above.

Sam:
 Overview: Worked with researching and implementing keyboard shortcuts. Code located in SamsBranch on github file named “keyboared_ex.html”.

Goals and Accomplishments: Goals were to implement keyboard shortcuts but ran into difficulty with implementation and workability with the NVDA. Could not implement because of issues with NVDA. Code presented in github from overview is code I had been working with and proof of some of my work. I was however able to keep designs edits without any issues with implementation of new code form group members.

Mary: was in charged for implementing a dynamic table with buttons that could add, save or remove table content. Also test code to be compatible with NVDA. 
Table implementation can be found in Mary’s branch under the folder “demo” in demo.html and script.js
The implementation of the table allows the user to delete, add and save data into the table through the buttons.
Final implementation of working code with NVDA is found in Aaron’s branch. 		
The implementation helps the NVDA read the content of the website accurately and help the user understand what the website is doing.


Team

Running application - 
Application can be run locally (not deployed to a remote server). To run, demo.html, script.js, and style.css must be located within the same directory. Navigate to this directory and open demo.html through a web browser (chrome preferred).

Readme on GitHub

What went well
The team was able to work together even though we all had to touch each other’s files at one point. 
Team achieved a working demo to functionally prototype the design of our idealized application.
Team achieved 
Team was able to finish assignments in a timely fashion.

What might be impeding us from performing better?
Heavy overhead of coursework from end of the semester deadlines and exams.
Shorter sprint with bigger goals than usual.

What can we do to improve
Communicate better as a group when working on eachother files, in sprint we managed to make it work. But it would have been a lot smoother if we communicated on what we are doing in what file. Can be measured by more structured pull/push requests to merge files more consistently and keep up with each other’s changes.
